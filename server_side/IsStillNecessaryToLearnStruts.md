Yes — I assume you mean the **Java SSH stack: Struts + Spring + Hibernate**.

The important answer is:

> **No, you generally don't need to learn Struts in depth for modern Java backend development. But understanding what Struts was and why it became popular is useful historical knowledge.**

### 1. What was "SSH"?

In the 2000s, **SSH** commonly referred to:

```text
S = Struts
S = Spring
H = Hibernate
```

They solved different problems:

```text
Struts
   ↓
Web / MVC layer

Spring
   ↓
Application / business layer

Hibernate
   ↓
Database / ORM layer
```

A typical application looked like:

```text
Browser
   ↓
Struts
   ↓
Spring
   ↓
Hibernate
   ↓
Database
```

This was a very influential Java enterprise architecture.

---

## 2. What happened to Struts?

Struts was one of the early major Java MVC web frameworks.

Instead of writing Servlets directly:

```text
Browser
   ↓
Servlet
   ↓
Java code
```

Struts provided a higher-level MVC framework:

```text
Browser
   ↓
Struts Controller
   ↓
Action
   ↓
Business logic
   ↓
JSP
```

But eventually **Spring MVC** became much more popular for new Java applications.

So the evolution is roughly:

```text
Servlet
   ↓
Struts
   ↓
Spring MVC
   ↓
Spring Boot
```

This isn't a strict replacement chain—Servlets are still underneath Spring MVC—but it is a useful historical progression.

---

## 3. What about Spring?

**Definitely learn Spring.**

Spring survived the transition because it wasn't just a web framework.

It provides concepts such as:

* Dependency Injection
* IoC
* Bean management
* AOP
* transactions
* MVC
* security
* data access
* integration

And **Spring Boot** made Spring much easier to configure and deploy.

Today, the important path is:

```text
Spring Framework
       ↓
Spring MVC
       ↓
Spring Boot
```

---

## 4. What about Hibernate?

**Definitely learn Hibernate/JPA concepts too.**

Hibernate is still highly relevant.

Today you'll often see:

```text
Spring Boot
    ↓
Spring Data JPA
    ↓
JPA
    ↓
Hibernate
    ↓
Database
```

There is an important distinction:

**JPA** = standard specification/API

**Hibernate** = implementation

**Spring Data JPA** = Spring abstraction that makes common JPA database operations easier.

For example:

```java
public interface UserRepository
        extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
}
```

You can perform database operations without writing a lot of JDBC code.

# 5. So what should you learn from SSH?

I'd recommend this:

| Technology      | Learn today? | Depth            |
| --------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Servlet         | ✅            | Fundamentals     |
| Tomcat          | ✅            | Fundamentals     |
| JSP             | ⚠️           | Basic/historical |
| Struts          | ⚠️           | Historical/basic |
| Spring          | ✅            | Deep             |
| Spring MVC      | ✅            | Deep             |
| Spring Boot     | ✅            | Deep             |
| Hibernate       | ✅            | Deep             |
| JPA             | ✅            | Deep             |
| Spring Data JPA | ✅            | Deep             |

In other words:

```text
             Modern Java Backend
                     │
          ┌──────────┴──────────┐
          ↓                     ↓
       Spring                 JPA
          ↓                     ↓
    Spring Boot             Hibernate
          ↓
     Spring MVC
          ↓
      Servlet
          ↓
       Tomcat
```

## 6. Why I would still learn Struts briefly

Because you're trying to understand **the evolution of Java backend architecture**, Struts is actually a useful piece of the puzzle.

You can see the progression:

```text
CGI
 ↓
Servlet
 ↓
JSP
 ↓
Struts
 ↓
Spring MVC
 ↓
Spring Boot
 ↓
REST API
 ↓
Modern distributed backend
```

Each generation tried to solve problems of the previous generation.

For example:

**Servlet**

> "How do I handle HTTP requests in Java?"

↓

**JSP**

> "How do I generate HTML more conveniently?"

↓

**Struts**

> "How do I organize a Java web application using MVC?"

↓

**Spring**

> "How do I manage the whole application's components and dependencies?"

↓

**Spring MVC**

> "How do I build web applications using Spring's architecture?"

↓

**Spring Boot**

> "How do I make Spring applications much easier to configure, run, and deploy?"

This historical perspective is particularly useful because it explains **why Spring Boot looks the way it does today**, rather than making all the annotations seem arbitrary.

### My recommendation for you

Don't spend time learning **Struts programming** now.

Spend perhaps **1–2 hours understanding its architecture and historical role**, then move on to:

**Servlet → Spring IoC/DI → Spring MVC → Spring Boot → REST → JPA/Hibernate → Spring Security → Microservices.**

That will give you much more value for a modern Java backend career.
